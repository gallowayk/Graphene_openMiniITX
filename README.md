An open-air mini-ITX case

This repository contains files for an open-air mini-ITX case I've designed. There are some kinks to work out, but it should be most of the way there. 

Details:
- Fully 3D printable, only necessitating M3 screws and M3 heatset inserts
- SFX or SFX-L compatbility
- 240mm radiator support (open loop or AIO)
- Supports Mini-ITX motherboards (upright or 90 degrees CCW rotation)


Plans for future designs:
- Design everything to be support free
- Design mATX version
- Attempt to further optimize space usage
- Redesign using parameters so the design is accurately scalable

Initial Print Settings:
- Infill:
-   - PLA: 100% (due to proximity of heat sources)
-   
-   - ASA, ABS, Nylon: 40%
- Octet or Gyroid infill
- 4 Perimeters (walls)


Note:
This design and derivatives cannot, and should not, be sold, used for commercial purposes, etc. Individual use is absolutely fine and remixing is welcome.
.stls will be available right off the bat
.step files will be added once everything has been confirmed
