An open [source] mini-ITX case

This repository is where I will house the open-source open-air mini-ITX case I've designed. There are some kinks to work out, but it should be most of the way there. 

Details:
- Fully 3D printable, only necessitating M3 screws and M3 heatset inserts
- SFX or SFX-L compatbility
- 240mm radiator support (open loop or AIO)
- Supports Mini-ITX motherboards (upright or 90 degrees CCW rotation)


Plans for future designs:
- Design everything to be support free
- Design mATX version
- Attempt to further optimize space usage
- Redesign using parameters so the design is accurately scalable
