# Graphene Open Air Mini-ITX Case - BETA

![image](https://github.com/gallowayk/Graphene_openMiniITX/blob/main/Images/main.png)


This repository contains files for an open-air mini-ITX case I've designed. There are some kinks to work out, but it should be most of the way there. 

Details:
- Fully 3D printable, only necessitating M3 screws and M3 heatset inserts
- SFX or SFX-L compatbility
- 240mm radiator support (open loop or AIO)
- Supports Mini-ITX motherboards (upright or 90 degrees CCW rotation)

Plans for future versions/variants:
- Official assembly guide
- mATX
- Fully support free
- Optimize space usage
- Space for system monitor display on front face
- Parameterize all dimensions

Suggested Print Settings:
- Infill:
  - PLA: 70-100% (due to proximity of heat sources)
  - ASA, ABS, Nylon: 40%
- Supports only neeed for PSU panel 
- Octet or Gyroid infill
- 4 Perimeters (walls)
- Orientation:
  - Upper:
    - Acceptable: Lying flat
    - Ideal: Print on side (warps easily and requires supports, but will be stronger)
  - Lower: 
    - Print on side with "Graphene" on build plate (printer needs to bridge decently)
  - Standoffs:
    - Print vertically
  - PSU panel
    - Lie flat on build plate, use 40% support density for a cleaner print
  - All other parts
    - Print with flattest side on bed

BOM (preliminary; subject to change)

Note:
This design and derivatives cannot, and should not, be sold, used for commercial purposes, etc. Individual use is absolutely fine and remixing is welcome.
.stls will be available right off the bat
.step files will be added once everything has been confirmed
